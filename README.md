# Gitleet

Gitleet is a platform that combines the GitHub contribution graph with the LeetCode graph and displays them in a single graph along with stats like current streak, longest streak, and total activity on both platforms. It also allows users to visualize the map like both platforms do. Gitleet uses Next.js for both frontend and backend, along with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn for styling.

## Features

- **Unified Contribution Graph**: View your GitHub and LeetCode contributions in a single graph.
- **Streak Tracking**: Monitor your current streak, longest streak, and total activity.
- **Visualization Tools**: Visualize your contributions similar to how GitHub and LeetCode do.
- **Next.js Framework**: Built with Next.js for a seamless frontend and backend experience.
- **Tailwind CSS and Shadcn**: Styled using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn for a modern and responsive design.
